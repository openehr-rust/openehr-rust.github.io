# openehr-postgresql

openEHR persistence for **PostgreSQL 18** — the schema dialect.

## Conformance level: Schema

This crate emits DDL for the shared openEHR schema, and a PostgreSQL 18 server
has executed it: five tables, seven indexes, idempotent on re-application,
foreign keys enforced, and both append-only tables refusing `UPDATE` and
`DELETE` with a row present and intact afterwards.

```sh
../openehr-store/scripts/verify-schema.sh postgresql
```

**It does not contain a store.** There is no driver dependency, no connection
handling, and no implementation of `Store`. Schema level means the database
accepts the schema, not that this crate can talk to it.

See [`openehr-store/spec/conformance.md`](../openehr-store/spec/conformance.md)
for what each level means and why they are stated this bluntly.

```rust
use openehr_postgresql::PostgresqlDialect;
use openehr_store::ddl_script;

println!("{}", ddl_script(&PostgresqlDialect));
```

## What this crate owns

Four things: type spellings, identifier quoting, placeholder style, and how the
engine enforces append-only. Everything else — which tables exist, which
columns, which indexes, the projection from openEHR objects onto rows, the
commit rules, the conformance suite — lives in
[`openehr-store`](../openehr-store) and is shared by all five engines.

That boundary is deliberate. The sibling FHIR monorepo in this repository gave
each of six ports a full copy of the DDL generator, and one of the copies spent
the fork's whole life emitting another engine's types (**F-08**). A dialect that
owns only spellings cannot do that, and
`openehr-sqlite/tests/dialects.rs` compares all five to make sure.

## PostgreSQL-specific choices

| Decision | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `text`, not `varchar(n)` | PostgreSQL stores both identically; the length would only add a check that rejects a long-but-legal `ARCHETYPE_ID`. |
| `jsonb`, not `json` | The canonical byte form is regenerated from the parsed object, never read back from the column, so preserving whitespace buys nothing and containment indexes buy a lot. |
| `timestamptz` for derived instants | The authoritative instant is stored as `text` alongside it — see below. |
| An append-only trigger | The guarantee lives in the database, not in application code, where it would end the first time somebody opened `psql`. |

## Every instant is stored twice, and that is the point

openEHR times are ISO 8601 **strings** with deliberate partial precision:
`2024-05` is a date known to the month, and it is not `2024-05-01`. A native
timestamp column silently completes it — fabricating a clinical fact — and
normalises the lexical form, breaking round-trip fidelity.

So each time occupies `…_text` (authoritative, exact) and `…_utc` (derived,
nullable, for ordering). The derived column is `NULL` whenever the instant is
not established, which is the same answer the library gives, so SQL and Rust
cannot disagree about one record.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test
```

The tests are golden: they assert the SQL this crate emits, including
assertions that it is *not* another engine's SQL.
