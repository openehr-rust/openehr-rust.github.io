# Conformance matrix

**Non-normative.** This records what is true today, not what is intended. It is
the file to distrust last: if it disagrees with the code, the code wins and this
file has a defect.

**Assessed:** 2026-08-02, against `rustc 1.97.1`, `openehr` 0.2.0. Rows touched
by **A-36** were re-derived 2026-08-20 against `openehr` 0.3.0 and `rustc 1.98.0`;
the rest carry the earlier date and have not been re-checked since, which is
stated rather than papered over (`W0.10`). The `D3.18b`/`D3.18c` rows were
derived 2026-08-21 with **A-35**.
**Method:** each requirement read against the code that implements it and the
test that exercises it; test names below are real and runnable with
`cargo test <name>`.

## Key

| | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **•** | Implemented **and** verified by a named test (`C0.7`) |
| **?** | Implemented, no test exercises it directly (`C0.8`) |
| **doc** | A documentation requirement; satisfied by prose, not by code |
| **type** | Enforced by the type system. A runtime test for it could not fail (`T13.2`), so writing one would be theatre. |
| **—** | Deliberately not implemented; see [`01-scope.md`](01-scope.md) |
| **spec** | Specified and **not implemented**: the requirement is in force, no code claims it, and the gap is tracked in [`audit.md`](audit.md). Distinct from **—**, which is a decision not to implement, and from **open**, which is a defect against something the crate purports to do |
| **withdrawn** | The requirement no longer stands. Its identifier is permanent (`C0.5`) and its text is kept where it was, marked, so a citation to it still resolves (`C0.18`, `C0.19`) |
| **open** | Not satisfied; tracked in [`audit.md`](audit.md) |

Doctests count as tests: they compile and run in CI (`T13.8`).

## Totals

Counted mechanically from the tables below, with every requirement id in
`spec/*.md` checked to appear exactly once — **344 ids, 344 covered, none
missing**.

A hand-written total in a file like this is a number nobody rechecks, and this
one proved the point: it said 291 of 291 while six requirements added after the
assessment had no row at all — `S1.18`, `S1.19`, `S1.20`, `L10.9`, `L10.10`,
`L10.11`. "Derived from the rows" was true once and then was not.

**CI now re-derives it** on every push, expanding the ranges in the `Id` column
and comparing against the requirements the specification defines. A new
requirement with no row fails the build; so does a row for a requirement that
does not exist, and so does an id covered twice.

**Re-derived 2026-08-26**, mechanically, from the rows below — and the previous
numbers were wrong, which is the second time this table has drifted from its own
tables. It said 291 total against 300 in the sentence above while the rows held
311, because CI re-derives *coverage* and nothing re-derived the *tally*.
**A-41** is the finding; the counts below were produced by expanding every `Id`
cell and counting statuses, and re-running that is how they should be checked
again.

| Status | 2026-08-26 | 2026-07-31 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • verified | 258 | 175 |
| doc | 33 | 30 |
| **spec** — in force, unimplemented | 28 | — |
| type | 13 | — |
| — out of scope | 8 | 6 |
| ? implemented, untested | 3 | 54 |
| withdrawn | 1 | — |
| open | 0 | 4 |
| **total requirements** | **344** | 269 |

The **spec** rows are §15 plus `S1.21`, added on 2026-08-26 when `S1.4` was
withdrawn and the Archetype Model brought into scope. There were 32 of them that
day; `K15.1`–`K15.4` — the AOM2 object model — were implemented and tested the
same day, leaving **28**. They remain the largest block of unsatisfied
requirements this crate has ever carried, and they are counted here rather than
described elsewhere so that the size of the gap is a number a reader can see.

Three things moved these numbers, and they are not the same thing.

**Requirements gained tests.** `tests/invariants.rs` closed **A-06**: 32 tests,
five of them mutation-verified by disabling the check and watching the test
fail.

**Thirteen were reclassified `type`** — enforced by the compiler, where a
runtime test could not fail and writing one would be theatre (`T13.2`). Calling
them `type` rather than `•` keeps the verified count meaning what it says.

**Twenty-two requirements were added**, and this is the part worth reading. The
rendered openEHR pages omit every class-definition table — the sources
`include::` them from a UML export generated at build time — so anything
implemented from the prose alone is a guess. All four Reference Model packages
have now been read from the published PDFs, and **all four times the primary
source contradicted what had been implemented**: three rules backwards, sixteen
invariants missing, five reported under names openEHR does not use, and one
place where **openEHR contradicts itself** (`V8.7a`). A rising total here is the
specification catching up with the one it implements.

The three remaining `?` are named individually below rather than lumped: a
constant-time claim nobody has timed, an error path that cannot be provoked, and
mutation verification being five checks rather than a policy.

## §0 Conformance — `C0`

Process requirements; they govern this specification rather than the code.

| Id | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C0.1–C0.3 | doc | this directory's prose |
| C0.4–C0.6 | • | every requirement in this directory carries an id; no gaps or reuse |
| C0.7–C0.11 | doc | this file, and [`audit.md`](audit.md) |
| C0.12–C0.14 | • | `I2.15` and `R4.9` are the two declared departures |
| C0.15–C0.18 | doc | commit conventions |
| C0.19 | doc | `S1.4` is the first exclusion reversed under it — withdrawn in place, reason kept, §15 named |

## §1 Scope — `S1`

| Id | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S1.1–S1.3 | • | `canonical_json::a_composition_covering_every_modelled_class_round_trips` |
| S1.4 | withdrawn | reversed 2026-08-26; the Archetype Model is in scope under `S1.21` and §15. Text kept in place, marked (`C0.19`) |
| S1.5–S1.7 | — | not implemented, by decision |
| S1.8 | • | `time_specification::tests::unimplemented_accessors_refuse_rather_than_guess` |
| S1.9 | • | `quantity::tests::different_units_are_not_comparable_in_either_direction` |
| S1.10 | • | `text::tests::rubric_checking_reports_unchecked_separately_from_valid` |

| S1.13 | • | `canonical_json` round trip covers `DV_PARSABLE` and time specifications |
| S1.14 | doc | `security` module header |
| S1.15 | doc | `J9.15`; bounded by `canonical_json::reading_a_composition_stays_within_a_small_stack` |
| S1.21 | spec | §15 in full; nothing implemented — **A-40** |
| S1.16–S1.17 | • | `terminology::tests::the_codes_that_disagree_between_terminology_repositories_are_the_current_ones` |
| S1.18 | — | declared departure: ISO 3166 and ISO 639 are not carried, so `COMPOSITION.Territory_valid` and `Language_valid` are not checked. Its closing requirement — that a caller can do the check instead — **is** verified: `guarantees::a_caller_can_read_every_code_the_crate_declines_to_check` (`A-19`) |
| S1.19 | — | declared exclusion: no demographic repository, so the four `PARTY` graph invariants cannot be checked from a value in hand |
| S1.20 | — | declared departure: an `EHR_ACCESS` may record no policy, so `Scheme_valid` is not checked. `X11.24`'s fail-closed default is why that is safe |

## §10 Validation — `L10`

| Id | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L10.1, L10.1a, L10.1b | • | `validation::tests::deserialization_bypasses_constructors_and_validation_catches_it` |

| L10.11 | • | the unenforced register, same file, same check — in both directions (`D-09` is the same defect one tree over) |

## §11 Security — `X11`

| X11.12 | ? | `Mac` implements neither `PartialEq` nor `Eq`, so `==` beside the one comparison does not compile; `guarantees::a_forged_tag_is_refused` pins the behaviour. Timing is still not measured, and the absence of the derive is not itself tested — see `Mac`'s documentation for why a `compile_fail` for it passed for the wrong reason |

| X11.24 | ? | `redact` returns `Result` and yields nothing on error, and the error path cannot be provoked. The premise is now tested — `guarantees::no_document_this_crate_can_build_carries_a_non_finite_float` — because `serde_json` writes `null` for a non-finite float rather than failing, so the constructors are the only barrier (**A-10**) |

## §13 Conformance testing — `T13`

| Id | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T13.1 | • | 222 of 276 requirements cite a test; 3 remain `?` and are named above |
| T13.2 | ? | `cargo-mutants` over every module of meaningful size in `openehr` (all now 0 or equivalent survivors — see the `lib:A-09` table in `spec/audit.md` for the full per-module count) plus `openehr-sqlite/{store,dialect}.rs`, `openehr-store/{integrity,record,dialect}.rs`, `openehr-loco`'s auth/controllers/access/app/tasks/views, and the five schema-level engine crates' `Dialect` impls. `openehr-store/conformance.rs` — the logic those numbers actually exercise — is measured from `openehr-sqlite`, not from `openehr-store` itself, because nothing in `openehr-store`'s own test target calls it. Not in CI as a standing gate (the `mutants` job covers only a PR's diff); `openehr-postgresql`/`mysql`/`mariadb`/`mssql`/`oracle`'s `store.rs`-equivalent logic doesn't exist (Schema level, no `Store` impl) and `App::before_run` has one structural residual — see `spec/audit.md` — and the six `-fuzz` crates are untouched — **A-09** |

| T13.8 | • | 79 doctests run in `cargo test` |
| T13.9 | — | no test in this crate self-skips |
| T13.10 | • | this file |
| T13.11 | • | `reading_a_composition_stays_within_a_small_stack` names its toolchain, method, and figures |
| T13.12–T13.13 | • | `cargo clippy --all-targets` is clean with the lint table in `Cargo.toml`, and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` at the crate root states it in the source as well — belt and braces, because a manifest edit removes the one and not the other |
| T13.14 | • | every `#[allow]` in the crate carries a reason |

## §15 Archetypes and templates — `K15`

The section was added on 2026-08-26 when `S1.4` was withdrawn. **Four rows are
satisfied and twenty-eight are not**: `openehr::am` is the AOM2 object model,
and no code in this crate parses ADL, flattens an archetype, expands a template,
reads an operational template, retrieves an artefact, or validates data against
one. **A-40** tracks the rest.

This table exists so that the gap is counted rather than described. A row moves
off **spec** when the code implements it *and* a named test exercises it
(`C0.7`) — not when a parser lands, and not when a README says so (`K15.30`,
`K15.31`).

| Id | Status | Evidence |

| K15.3 | • | `archetype_model::an_archetype_round_trips_through_json_unchanged`, `…a_constraint_this_crate_cannot_model_survives_rather_than_disappearing`. **Scope:** the only serialisation this crate accepts today is its own JSON. ADL and the AM ITS forms are `K15.5`, `K15.8`, and `K15.16`, all below |
| K15.4 | • | `archetype_model::an_archetype_is_constructible_without_a_parser` |
| K15.5–K15.7 | spec | ADL 2 parsing, and the refusal discipline that replaces recovery |
| K15.8–K15.10 | spec | ADL 1.4 ingestion, provenance, and the assertion subset |
| K15.11–K15.13 | spec | specialisation, flattening, and the narrowing check |
| K15.14–K15.17 | spec | template expansion and operational templates, both directions |
| K15.18–K15.23 | spec | validation against an operational template, and its separateness from `L10.x` |
| K15.24–K15.27 | spec | the repository abstraction, provenance, and the refusal on retrieval failure |
| K15.28–K15.29 | spec | the boundaries this section does **not** move: authoring, publishing, AQL execution |
| K15.30–K15.31 | spec | the honesty gate while the rest is unbuilt — refuse, and do not describe a parser as archetype support |
